# Detect-Pegasus
Pegasus spyware is a type of highly sophisticated spyware that can infect mobile devices (mainly smartphones) and monitor, control, or extract information from the devices. It is often used by state actors or other malicious groups for espionage purposes. The spyware is capable of remotely exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the phone's camera, microphone, GPS, messages, calls, and other data.

Writing code to detect Pegasus spyware specifically requires advanced techniques, as the spyware employs numerous evasive strategies to avoid detection. For example, it often exploits zero-day vulnerabilities, uses encryption to hide its activities, and communicates with remote command-and-control servers. Therefore, detecting it involves sophisticated methods such as traffic analysis, deep packet inspection, forensic analysis, and anti-malware techniques.

However, since the nature of Pegasus spyware involves bypassing common security systems and exploiting vulnerabilities that aren't easily detectable by traditional antivirus programs, I will outline the general approach you could take to detect traces of spyware on a system.
Detection and Removal Approach for Spyware Like Pegasus

Here are some general techniques and strategies used to detect spyware like Pegasus:

    Detect Unusual Network Traffic:
        Pegasus spyware often communicates with remote servers. You can detect unusual network traffic or communication with suspicious IP addresses, domains, or servers.
        Example: Look for network traffic going to unusual or known malicious IP addresses (often used for C2 communication).

    Look for Malicious or Unauthorized Processes:
        If the spyware is running in the background, you could try to identify unusual or unauthorized processes running on the system, such as processes that shouldn't be there.

    Check for Suspicious Permissions:
        Analyze permissions granted to apps on the device, such as access to the microphone, camera, and GPS. If the permissions granted are suspicious or inconsistent with normal usage, it could indicate spyware.

    Analyze File System and Storage:
        Spyware often tries to hide its files or store its components in non-obvious locations. Analyze the file system for suspicious files or directories.

    Reverse Engineering:
        In some cases, reverse-engineering apps and their code (if it’s installed on the phone) can help detect spyware. This process would require specialized skills in reverse engineering and debugging.

Python Code Example for Basic Network Traffic Analysis (Detecting Suspicious Traffic):

Below is an example Python script that can help monitor network traffic on a local network and identify connections that might be associated with spyware-like behavior. This is just a basic example and won't detect Pegasus directly, but it's a starting point for traffic analysis.
Prerequisites:

    Install the required packages:

    pip install psutil scapy

    Use the psutil package to monitor network connections and scapy to analyze packets.

Python Code Example:

import psutil
import scapy.all as scapy
import time

# List of known suspicious IP addresses (to be updated based on threat intelligence)
SUSPICIOUS_IPS = [
    "192.168.1.100",  # Example of suspicious IP (replace with known malicious IPs)
    "203.0.113.45"
]

# Function to check active network connections
def check_active_connections():
    print("Checking active network connections...")
    # Get all current network connections
    connections = psutil.net_connections(kind='inet')
    
    for conn in connections:
        # If the connection's remote address is suspicious, flag it
        remote_ip = conn.raddr.ip if conn.raddr else None
        if remote_ip and remote_ip in SUSPICIOUS_IPS:
            print(f"Suspicious connection found: {remote_ip} (PID: {conn.pid})")
            try:
                # Get the process info associated with the suspicious connection
                proc = psutil.Process(conn.pid)
                print(f"Process Name: {proc.name()}, Path: {proc.exe()}")
            except psutil.NoSuchProcess:
                continue

# Function to capture packets on the network and identify suspicious patterns
def packet_sniffer():
    print("Starting network packet sniffing...")
    
    # Define the callback function to analyze packets
    def analyze_packet(packet):
        if packet.haslayer(scapy.IP):
            ip_src = packet[scapy.IP].src
            ip_dst = packet[scapy.IP].dst
            if ip_dst in SUSPICIOUS_IPS:
                print(f"Suspicious packet detected: {ip_src} -> {ip_dst}")
                print(packet.summary())
    
    # Start sniffing packets (this will capture packets for a short duration)
    scapy.sniff(prn=analyze_packet, timeout=60)

# Main function to start monitoring for Pegasus-like behavior
def main():
    print("Starting spyware detection...")
    
    # Step 1: Monitor active network connections
    check_active_connections()
    
    # Step 2: Analyze network packets for suspicious traffic
    packet_sniffer()
    
    print("Spyware detection complete!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

How the Code Works:

    Active Network Connections Monitoring:
        The script monitors active network connections using psutil. If any active connection is established with a suspicious IP address, it flags the connection and attempts to identify the process associated with that connection.

    Packet Sniffing:
        Using scapy, the script captures network packets in real-time and checks for traffic that is being sent to suspicious IP addresses. This is useful for detecting unauthorized or malicious outbound communication (such as C2 servers used by spyware like Pegasus).

Important Notes:

    Known Suspicious IPs/Domains: The list of suspicious IPs used in the example (SUSPICIOUS_IPS) is arbitrary. To make this more useful, you would need to keep a dynamic or updated list of IPs or domains that are known to be associated with spyware. Threat intelligence feeds or databases could be used for this.

    False Positives: Not all suspicious traffic is necessarily malicious. Some legitimate applications may use similar IP addresses or protocols. It's important to analyze the context of the connections further.

    Advanced Detection Techniques: Pegasus spyware uses advanced evasion techniques, and detection is difficult without a deep understanding of its behavior. For example:
        Monitoring rootkits or any deep system-level interactions requires specialized tools and methods.
        Reverse engineering or mobile device forensics would be needed to fully analyze and identify Pegasus if it's running on a mobile device.

How to Extend This Further:

    Update Suspicious Indicators:
        Continuously update the list of suspicious IPs and domains based on threat intelligence feeds from trusted sources (e.g., FireEye, CrowdStrike).
    Implement File System Monitoring:
        You can write Python scripts that scan specific directories for abnormal or hidden files (e.g., using os and psutil to look for unusual or new files created in system directories).
    Use External Tools:
        For more advanced analysis, you might integrate external tools like Wireshark for network packet inspection or use mobile forensics tools like Cellebrite for deep analysis of mobile devices.

Conclusion:

Detecting sophisticated spyware like Pegasus requires a multi-layered approach and often involves collaboration with cybersecurity experts and access to threat intelligence. The Python code provided offers a starting point for network traffic analysis, but it’s crucial to combine it with other techniques like file system monitoring and specialized tools to identify and remove the spyware. Additionally, real-world detection would require constant updates to the detection patterns and sophisticated methods that go beyond simple traffic analysis.
